If this is a new tool, create a new folder under tools for your work with an appropriate name. Create a PRD.md and create stories and tasks under it as per the spec

Use uv for project management and pytest for testing

Pick up the most important task from PRD.md and start working on it

Create a notes.md file in that folder and append notes to it as you work, anything you tried or learned along the way that will be helpful for future agents.

If you need to create more tasks do it in inside PRD.md and under a story where task belong. If the story does not exist add the story as well

Add appropirate test for your work. try not to use mocks unless necessary

Mark a task done in PRD after the task is completed and tests are passing 

Build/update README.md at the end if the story is finished

Your final commit should include just that folder and selected items from its contents:
- The notes.md, PRD.md and README.md files
- Any code you wrote along the way
- If you checked out and modified an existing repo, the output of "git diff" against that modified repo saved as a file - but not a copy of the full repo
- If appropriate, any binary files you created along the way provided they are less than 2MB in size
Do NOT include full copies of code that you fetched as part of your investigation. Your final commit should include only new files you created or diffs showing changes you made to existing code.

After everything is done update the root README.md with the tool's information
